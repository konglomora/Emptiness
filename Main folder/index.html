                        <p> Astronauts have had to be smart and do-it-yourself on so many occasions to fix a technical
                            glitch or overcome the consequences of a life-threatening accident that it can boggle any
                            imagination. <br>
                            Houston, we have a problem! "This immortal phrase has become a catch phrase and denotes an
                            emergency, emergency situation not only in space, but also in any place on Earth. By the
                            way, this is an inaccurate quote. As it turned out, in the original version the phrase
                            sounded like this:" Houston, we had a problem!

                        <h5>The first American in space</h5>
                        <p> February 1971. Apollo 14 commander Alan Shepard, the first American in space, prepares to
                            spend his second day on the moon. After a short breakfast, Shepard and lunar module pilot Ed
                            Mitchell descend the ramp to spend an entire day in geological surveys on the lunar surface.
                            They became the first crew to use a two-wheeled cart, a modular equipment transporter that
                            they dragged along the lunar surface and quickly filled with rocks.
                            <br> The couple were almost exhausted, climbing the slope of another crater, and the MCC
                            wanted to return them to the descent vehicle by all means. However, Shepard had yet another
                            task to complete.

                            <br> "Houston," Shepard said, gripping the long handle of the device he used to collect rock
                            samples, "you probably know what I have in my hand?" Everyone who was at that time in the
                            control center stared at the video monitors. "It just so happened that I have a real iron
                            here with me, the sixth number." (Iron is a metal type of golf club with a spade-shaped
                            head. - Ed.)

                            <br> Wasting no time, Shepard pulled a ball out of his pocket, threw it onto the lunar
                            surface and stabbed it with an impromptu club. A fountain of dust rose, but the ball flew
                            only a few meters. The second blow brought a much more satisfactory result: after describing
                            an arc, the ball disappeared from sight.

                            <br> Since then, there has been a debate about how far the ball flew. You can put an end to
                            the dispute only by returning to the moon.

                        <h5>David Griggs and Jeff Hoffman</h5>
                        <p> Astronauts David Griggs and Jeff Hoffman carried out an unplanned spacewalk to attach a fly
                            swatter to a manipulator, while Ree Seddon attempted to revive the satellite. Alas, the
                            antenna still refused to open.

                            <br> However, not all was lost. During the next shuttle flight in August of the same year,
                            astronauts James Van Hoffen and William Fischer managed to mount a new module on the
                            satellite during their spacewalk and successfully put it into orbit.

                                spacesuit, so we made him a captain. The captain has full power on board the ship. In
                                civil aviation, the captain is the commander of the aircraft. The law gives the captain
                                of a seagoing vessel very great powers, he acts as a judge and bailiff. The captains
                                also traditionally performed religious rites, conducted the Divine Liturgy on board,
                                crowned and buried the dead. In many cases, even a person senior in rank or position was
                                not allowed to give orders to bypass the captain. According to the unwritten law of the
                                sea, the captain had to leave the ship last.

                            <h5>Spaceship</h5>
                            <p space-top-small>A manned spacecraft designed to carry out flights of people in outer
                                space and, in particular, to deliver people into space and their safe return to Earth
                                (or another planet / satellite / space station). The first manned spacecraft was the
                                Soviet spacecraft Vostok-1, on which Yuri Gagarin made the first full-fledged space
                                flight, circling the Earth at the first space speed.

                                One of the main problems in the design of this class of spacecraft is the creation of a
                                safe, reliable and accurate system for returning the crew to the earth's surface in the
                                form of a wingless descent vehicle (SA) or a spaceplane. In addition, an important
                                feature is the presence of an emergency rescue system (SAS) at the initial stage of
                                launching by a launch vehicle (LV). The projects of the first generation spacecraft did
                                not have a full-fledged rocket SAS - instead of it, as a rule, ejection of the crew
                                seats was used, the winged spaceplanes are also not equipped with a special SAS. Also,
                                the spacecraft must be equipped with a life support system (LSS) for the crew.

                            <p space-top-small>The concept of space flight is different in different countries.
                                According to the classification of the International Federation of Aeronautics (FAI),
                                space flight is considered to be a flight whose altitude exceeds 100 km. According to
                                the classification of the United States Air Force (United State Air Forces, USAF), a
                                space flight is a flight whose altitude exceeds 50 miles (80 km 467 m). In Russia, space
                                flight is called an orbital flight, that is, a flight in which the device must make at
                                least one revolution around the Earth. That is why the total number of astronauts in
                                different sources differs.</p>

                            <h2>Universe</h2>
                            <p space-top-small>The universe is not a rigidly defined concept in astronomy and
                                philosophy. It is divided into two fundamentally different entities: speculative
                                (philosophical) and material, accessible to observation at the present time or in the
                                foreseeable future. If the author distinguishes between these entities, then, following
                                tradition, the first is called the Universe, and the second - the astronomical Universe
                                or Metagalaxy (recently this term has practically gone out of use).

                                Historically, various words have been used to denote "all space", including equivalents
                                and variants from different languages, such as "space", "world", "celestial sphere". The
                                term "macrocosm" has also been used, although it is intended to define large-scale
                                systems, including their subsystems and parts. Likewise, the word "microcosm" is used to
                                refer to small scale systems.

                                Any research, any observation, whether it is the observation of a physicist at how the
                                nucleus of an atom is breaking, a child at a cat, or an astronomer observing a distant
                                galaxy - all this is an observation of the Universe, or rather, of its individual parts.
                                These parts serve as the subject of study of individual sciences, and astronomy and
                                cosmology are engaged in the Universe on the largest possible scale, and even the
                                Universe as a whole; in this case, the Universe is understood as either the region of
                                the world covered by observations and space experiments, or the object of cosmological
                                extrapolations - the physical Universe as a whole.
